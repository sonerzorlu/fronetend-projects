        Being a great developer means that you can communicate effectively with
        users and other developers. In fact, a large part of being an excellent
        programmer is sharing your ideas effectively and efficiently. If you can
        present your ideas clearly and concisely, others will want to listen to
        what you have to say. But communication isn't just about talking. It's
        also about listening to what others have to say. Studies show that good
        listeners were more successful in their careers than good talkers. So
        you should never underestimate the power of a good listener, especially
        when working with clients or other developers on your team. Learning how
        to listen can be invaluable, especially if you're planning on working
        with other people.
